I have been working on improving the performance of my website for a while now. I am happy to announce that I finally got a perfect score of 100 on Lighthouse.

## What is Lighthouse?

Lighthouse is an open-source tool developed by Google that helps you improve the quality of your web pages. It provides a set of audits that analyze your website's performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Lighthouse generates a report with suggestions on how to improve your website's performance and user experience.

I struggled to increase the Lighthouse score, so I read many things about Core Web Vitals and how to improve them.
